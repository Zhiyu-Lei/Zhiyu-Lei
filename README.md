### Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I am Zhiyu (Oliver) Lei, a software engineer at DraftKings. I completed my bachelor's degree at University of Rochester in May 2022 and then my master's degree at University of Pennsylvania in December 2023. I am very interested in fields related to science, technology, and so on. I am a coder believing in the power of data and algorithms. I received professional data science and machine learning training from my undergraduate study. I also explored further in artificial intelligence and distributed systems in my graduate program.

Coding is basic; machine learning is plus. My previous practical work and projects honed my ability of coding (in C++, C#, Java, Python) and working with various data structures and algorithms, and also skills to use machine learning libraries and frameworks including NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, etc. I am familiar with data processing pipelines and technologies such as the Databricks platform, and have experience working with relational and NoSQL databases, as well as some experience with cloud-native and containerized environments of Docker and Kubernetes.

Through my coursework and internships, I gained valuable experience in production-level programming, mining patterns and insights from data, building analysis tools and pipelines, and developing automation scripts. I also cultivated the competence of rigorous logical thinking and efficient team-working. In both my academic and professional life, I am meticulous and not afraid of difficulties, and I always pursue perfection. I am also good at analyzing and solving problems from various perspectives. I look forward to contributing to the era of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence as a tech expert.

I am always looking for some interesting projects to work on. Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhiyu-lei/).
