### Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I am Zhiyu (Oliver) Lei, a Computer and Information Science master's student at University of Pennsylvania. I completed my bachelor's degree at University of Rochester in May 2022. I am very interested in fields related to science, technology, transportation and so on. I am particularly passionate for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and I have achieved a lot through those challenging courses at school. I gained valuable experience in programming at production level, mining patterns and insights from data, and building analysis tools and pipelines through my course works as well as internships. I also developed competences of rigorous logical thinking and efficient team-working. In both my academic and professional life, I am meticulous and not afraid of difficulties, and I always pursue perfection. I am also good at analyzing and solving problems from various perspectives. I look forward to contributing to the era of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence as a tech expert.

I am always looking for some interesting projects to work on, and I am also seeking opportunities for next summer. Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhiyu-lei/).
